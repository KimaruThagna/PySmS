# PySmS
Leverage on the twilio API framework to send sms in python. The script is basic and very simple as it deals with a twillio trial account which is limited
Create an account on twillio, the basic and free account will provide you with an account sid, auth_token and a twillio number.
Whichever number will be given, just accept it. Being a trial account, you can only give one number to be the recepient and that number has to be verified so i suggest you submit yours.
upon receiving all the info, create a file called credentials.py and place the info there. sid,a_token,my_twillio_num and my cell.
These will be used by the send_sms.py script to execute.
Since it is in python, anything in python,....all the functions and libraries are at your disposal as long as you send the message as a string.
In the script, i have used the example of euclidian distance.
This can be implemented to serve a great purpose and respond to a user via sms.
can also be implemented in ecommerce sites in conjunction witha web framework like django.
The possibilities are endless
